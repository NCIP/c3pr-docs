</tr><tr><td>602</td><td>C3PR Release 2.0 Construction Phase</td><td>Technical </td><td>There is no standard way to uniquely identify a protocol.  This will make it difficult to share registration (and other) data between systems.  </td><td>5 = 100% (risk as occurred)</td><td>(O) Operational</td><td>(PND) Pending</td><td>A standard way to identify protocols in C3PR will be instituted.  This will be investigated by Ram Chilukuri as it pertains to C3PR V1.

The issues involved in using it for implementing the service oriented architecture (SOA) are not completely known at this point of time. Also, the Duke team has limited expertise in using it to develop enterprise applications.  Issues that arise due to the use of the LogicBlaze FUSE ESB may significantly hamper the progress of C3PR V2 development effort.</td><td>1 = approximately 25% (possible but not likely that Risk will occur in next 30 days)</td><td>(M) Moderate</td><td>(PND) Pending</td><td>We request BAH to facilitate setting up couple of telecon’s with the caXChange development team to discuss the issues and lessons learnt in using the LogicBlaze FUSE ESB.</td><td>12</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>11/16/2006 2:06:27 PM</td><td>11/16/2006</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>No comments now - this shouldn't be a required field.</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>External</td></tr><tr><td>607</td><td>C3PR Release 2.0 Construction Phase</td><td>Technical </td><td>There may be IRB issues associated with data sharing using the caGrid infrastructure between sites cooperating on a clinical study protocol.</td><td>1 = approximately 25% (possible but not likely that Risk will occur in next 30 days)</td><td>(O) Operational</td><td>(PND) Pending</td><td>The lead elaborators will investigate independently with their local IRBs.
