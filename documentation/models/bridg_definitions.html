A planned study theoretically occurs before a study starts.

A planned study is usually submitted to an IRB or sponsoring organization for review and approval before the study is executed.

NOTE: For the purpose of Release 1, this is a collector of planned activities. Study and StudyProtocol include additional concepts including ( design, methodology, statistical considerations and organization).</td>

			<tr><td>SubmissionUnitRelationship</td><td>1 attribute(s)</td><td>This defines the relationship between a submission and the submissionUnits. 

For example, in RPS, many times the submissions units are transmitted to the regulatory agency as the data is available, but the submission unit may actually be evaluated in a different order than the order that it was submitted.  This is particularly useful when a submission unit is an amendment, or a revision to a previous submission. The submission order helps to clarify which submission unit should be evaluated next. 

Note: we need the dynamic aspects of the model that help to describe the way in which the receipt dates and sequence numbers relate to one another. It also means that we should link the activity diagrams to the state diagrams to help describe the semantics that articulate the regulatory timelines for evaluating the submission unit.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>SubmissionUnitRelationship</td><td>sequenceNumber</td><td>A number specifying the relative sequential or temporal ordering of this relationship among other like-types relationships having the same source Activity. 

&lt;DISCUSSION&gt; An action plan is a composite Activity with component Activities. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Multiple components with the same sequenceNumber make a branch. Branches can be exclusive (case-switch) or can indicate parallel processes indicated by the splitCode. 

If value is null, the relative position of the target Activity is unspecified. (i.e. it may occur anywhere.)

Use the 'priorityNumber' attribute to indicate relative preference instead of order of occurrence.

For example, in RPS this determines the order the submission unit should be processed. If a submission unit is received by the regulatory authority out of order, the sequence number tells the regulatory authority the order the submission units should be read.

For example, a protocol document is submission in the original submission. In the first amendment that protocol document is withdrawn and the second amendment the protocol document is reactivated. We know that the protocol document should still be considered since the second amendment has a greater sequence number.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr><td>ReviewableUnit</td><td>0 attribute(s)</td><td>The reviewable unit is a way to organize a submission into discrete units. The reviewable unit is used to receive agreement on one unit. Once agreement is reached on all units within the submission the submission can then be approved.

For example, in a Modular premarketing application (PMA) several modules will be sent to the FDA. Each module will be agreed upon independently of other modules. The FDA then approves the submission based on compilation of all of the modules. These modules are reviewable units.

For example, a veterinary medicine NADA (marketing application) is constructed from the INADA (investigational application). In the INADA process the sponsor creates reviewable units. These reviewable units are then compiled to be used as documentation for the marketing application.</td>

(i.e. neither participants nor specified dates have yet been associated within the activity) 

For example, A CBC will take place on the fourth day of the study.  This is specified by the design of the study.  </td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>PlannedCalendar</td><td>2 attribute(s)</td><td>A business process state of a calendar (represented here as a subtype).  Used to organize the timing, conditions/rules and the activities of a study.  

Three critical features of a planned calendar include: 
1. It is associated with a particular study
2. It does not represent absolute dates, but rather focuses on activity specific timing and inter-activity relationships relative to a reference point.    
3. It is not associated with study subjects.   

For example, most studies contain one or more planned calendars, (i.e. one planned calendar for each treatment arm) each in the form of a matrix of time (horizontal axis) and activities (vertical axis).  This matrix is therefore made up of individual cells and a planned calendar is defined by checking a cell, thereby associating a specific activity to a specific time.  Planned calendars are often referred to as Schedule of Activities or Schedule of Events.  </td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>PlannedCalendar</td><td>effectiveDateTime</td><td>Time at which the planned calendar can be used to instantiate a subject's schedule. 
For example,  the study is set up with a set of visits, and there is a revision to the plan that requires an additional visit. This means that a new revision is made to the protocol that modifies the plan. A subject that has started one plan will finish that older plan, while new patients entering the trial would need to follow the new plan with the latest amendment.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>PlannedCalendar</td><td>referenceTimePoint</td><td>This is the reference point that is used to calculate when planned subject events are planned to occur. 
For example, in bone marrow transplantation clinical trials, the reference time point might be the day that the transplantation occurs. 
For example, in other clinical trials, the reference point might be the point at which informed consent is obtain, or the point at which a patient is defined to have entered or started the trial. 

For example, in the patient study calendar project, this is the earliest activity described in the patient calendar.  This would be "day 1".  This is not an absolute calendar date (December 18, 2006), but a reference day (Day 1 is the first day of chemotherapy).
For example, In SDTM, day 1 might be the first day that a particular subject gets a particular drug.

&lt;NOTE&gt; In SDTM, this is in the DMdomain, RFSTDTC in the planning mood (it has difference semantics in the performed mood). </td>

Clinical trials are generally categorized into four (sometimes five) phases described separately herein. An investigational medicine or product may be evaluated in two or more phases simultaneously in different trials, and some trials may overlap two different phases. 

Phase 1: The initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects.  
Phase 2: Controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug.
Phase 3: Studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. 
Phase 3b: Phase 3b studies are a sub category of phase 3 trials near the time of approval to elicit additional findings.
Phase 4:  Concurrent with marketing approval, FDA may seek agreement from the sponsor to conduct certain postmarketing (phase 4) studies to delineate additional information about the drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use. 
Phase 5: Postmarketing surveillance is sometimes referred to as Phase 5.

			<tr><td>CD</td><td>qualifier</td><td>Contains the value of the modified text when the original text is modified for coding purposes.  

For example, spelling corrections, dropping of extraneous information, splitting of compound verbatims like "nausea and vomiting" into separate concepts when the coding scheme doesn't have a single code for the text. </td>

			</tr>
			<tr><td>StudyAuthor</td><td>0 attribute(s)</td><td>The individual who is primarily responsible for the content of a planned study.

For example, for cancer center trials, this is often the link between the investigator role and the planned study.  For pharmaceutical trials, the author of the study and the PI may be different. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>12 attribute(s)</td><td>A collection of data. A documentation can be either physical or logical. In either case, it has the following characteristics: 1) Stewardship, 2) Potential for authentication, 3) Wholeness, 4) Human readability, 5) Persistence, 6) Global vs local context (the person that signs it is the author of all sections unless otherwise noted).  This class is an abstract concept that contains attributes common to all types of study documents. [HL7 CDA]

For example, in RPS, regulatory processes require the submission of documents from the Applicant to the Regulatory Authority. These documents are varied in focus and are often defined by the field of study (i.e., GLP or GCP guidelines) or by the regulatory application requirements of the region or Regulatory Authority (e.g., Integrated Summary of Safety, Pharmacokinetics Written Summary). 

NOTE: We use the term "documentation" to help people think of the contents of the documents, rather than the physical entity of a "document". </td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>detailedDescription</td><td>Text which is a full or comprehensive narrative/explanation.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>documentationType</td><td>A string or code that identifies a general class or category of documents, for example, amendment, background material, guide, etc.

For example, in RPS, this is the code that specifies how the file is to be used within the submission process (e.g. Protocol, Summary Introduction). Note: The codes may vary between different product types (application types). 

For example, a RegulatoryRecord - A document that meets a record requirement of a regulatory authority and must be retained in accordance with that agencyâ€™s records retention requirements.  Example: Data Clarification Form (DCF)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>identifier</td><td> A code that uniquely identifies a documentation. A particular documentation can have one or more ID.

For example,  an identifier assigned by some organization in the context of a study, for example, sponsor protocol number, national number, cooperative group protocol number, CDISC protocol identifying number. [PR modeling group]

For example, in the RPS message, this identifies the file (with a URI), which is part of the documentation. A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), is a compact string of characters used to identify or name a resource. The main purpose of this identification is to enable interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. URIs are defined in schemes defining a specific syntax and associated protocols.
</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>language</td><td>For character based information the language property specifies the human language of the text. This would be selected from a list of possible languages.
</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>revision</td><td>A string or code which identifies a given collection of content of a documentation at a point in time. 

For example, over time, there may be multiple changes to a documentation, and the revision allows an individual to capture relationships between changes in the instances of a documentation over time. There can be a new revision every time the content changes. 

For example, in RPS this could be operationalized as follows: The version number would be an integer starting at '1' and incrementing by 1. The first instance or original report should always be valued as '1'. The version number value must be incremented by one when a report is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements. 

Different versions of the same document belong to the same documentation group.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>status</td><td>The status is an attribute that defines the various states that a documentation can exist in. 

For example, in RPS, the status of the documentation is either active or obsolete. This is used to determine if the documentation should be considered as part of the regulatory decision.

Other documentations could have other status -- pending, under review, signed, submitted, etc. These are specific to particular state diagrams used to support a particular use case.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>statusEndDate</td><td>The date after which a status is no longer considered active, enforceable, relevant, etc.

For example, effectiveEndDate may refer to the closing of a study to enrollment. Patients enrolled on the study at the time of closure will continue their treatment plan.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>statusStartDate</td><td>The date when this particular status becomes active.

For example, in protocol, the effective date may be the date of IRB approval of the initial protocol version; the date the IRB Chair signs off on a protocol and patient enrollment can begin.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>subtype</td><td>Contains name value pairs that are used within the context of an application.  Each subtype/keyword is an item of information that provides context for the documentation.  Keywords are used only to further define the context of documentation, and the keywords, by themselves, have no intrinsic value. 

Only certain types of documentation, as defined by the codes, can be further defined by keywords.

Keywords can also be defined in other coding systems. In those cases a keyword would not have to be created, the logical document would point directly to the other coding system.

Species, indication, manufacturer, biocompatibility, facility, drug substance, drug product. Each one of these are associated with a type code. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>summaryDescription</td><td>Text which abstracts the salient information from the detailedDescription.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>synopsis</td><td>Text which abstracts the salient information from the summaryDescription.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>Documentation</td><td>title</td><td>The briefest description of the content of the documentation. 

For example, Descriptive text used to represent the long title or name of a protocol.

For example, the title of a protocol limited to 30 characters in length.

For example, "protocol", "benchmark test" would be examples of titles for documentation. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>PerformedActivity</td><td>4 attribute(s)</td><td>A business process state of an activity (represented here as a subtype) which describes activities which have been successfully or unsuccessfully completed. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>PerformedActivity</td><td>missedReason</td><td>The text that describes the rationale behind why a PerformedActivity is not done.

This captures SDTM's REASND Domain. At present there is no coded set of values.  In HL7, there is a list of permissible missing value types, and we need to ensure that HL7's list is a superset of what is needed by SDTM.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>PerformedActivity</td><td>performedEndDateTime</td><td>The point in time when this activity ended.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>PerformedActivity</td><td>performedReason</td><td>Text specifying the motivation, cause, or rationale of an Activity. 

The datatype for this is string because the notion of  HL7's reasonCode may be moved to ActRelationship.

For example, re-test, unscheduled or termination. For unscheduled, the event that occurred was initiated by a study participant and did not occur for protocol-specified reasons.

For example, reasons that might qualify for being coded in this field might be: "routine requirement", "infectious disease reporting requirement", "on patient request", "required by law".</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>PerformedActivity</td><td>performedStartDateTime</td><td>The point in time when this activity began.

For example, the datetime when sample was taken from the subject. 

For example, a dose of chemotherapy was given on June 12th starting at 9am and finishing at 12pm.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>StudySponsor</td><td>1 attribute(s)</td><td>An individual company, institution, or organization that takes responsibility for the initiation, management, and/or financing of a study.  Study sponsor can be primary or secondary. 

For example, Abbott Labs, US National Cancer Institute (NCI), Alkermes, Inc., Angiotech, Amgen, etc.

The FDA considers the IND holder the primary sponsor. The WHO considers the primary sponsor the individual, organization, group or other legal person taking on responsibility for securing the arrangements to initiate and/or manage a study (including arrangements to ensure that the study design meets appropriate standards and to ensure appropriate conduct and reporting).  In commercial trials, the primary sponsor is normally the main applicant for regulatory authorization to begin the study. It may or may not be the main funder. (WHO v1.0)

WHO defines a secondary sponsor as additional individuals, organizations or other legal persons, if any, that have agreed with the primary sponsor to take on responsibilities of sponsorship.  A secondary sponsor may have agreed to take on all the responsibilities of sponsorship jointly with the primary sponsor; or to form a group with the primary sponsor in which the responsibilities of sponsorship are allocated among the members of the group; or to act as the sponsorâ€™s legal representative in relation to some or all of the trial sites to take responsibility for the accuracy of trial registration information submitted. (WHO v1.0) </td>

			<tr><td>ConcomitantAgent</td><td>0 attribute(s)</td><td>Substances used by the subject either prior to or during the study that are not specified by the protocol. Currently, we do not have a use case to include elicit drugs as concomitant agents. 

For example, blood pressure medication prescribed either before or during a chemotherapy therapeutic trial.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>II</td><td>4 attribute(s)</td><td>An identifier that uniquely identifies a thing or object. Examples are object identifier for HL7 RIM objects, medical record number, order id, service catalog item id, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), etc. 


For example: sponsor protocol number, site id, investigator id, subject id, accession id, etc. 

The assigningAuthority attribute is necessary to provide a context on who set that id for the study id, investigator id, etc.

Similar to InstanceIdentifier data type of HL7 v3.  </td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>II</td><td>assigningAuthorityName</td><td>A human readable name or mnemonic for the assigning authority. The Assigning Authority Name has no computational value. The purpose of a Assigning Authority Name is to assist an unaided human interpreter of an II value to interpret the authority. Note: no automated processing must depend on the assigning authority name to be present in any form. [HL7]

For example, the name of the organization who issued the extension.</td>
