</tr><tr><td>667</td><td>C3PR Release 2.0 Construction & Transition Phase</td><td>Technical </td><td>caBIG lacks a module for creating and managing a study definition.  If studies are not kept synchronized between multi-site C3PRs, then functionality may not work properly.</td><td>5 = 100% (risk as occurred)</td><td>(M) Moderate</td><td>(OCC) Occurred</td><td>Raise the issue to BAH.

The caTRIP IRB application will be used as a model to infer this.

Appropriate workarounds for C3PR will be determined (potentially using more traditional technologies such as web services).</td><td>Internal</td></tr><tr><td>676</td><td>C3PR Release 2.0 Construction & Transition Phase</td><td>Resource </td><td>All year three task elements must be delivered and invoiced for by the end of the caBIG year (March 1).

This may not play well with the CTMSi SSO model.</td><td>4 = approximately >75% but <100% (risk will almost certainly occur within next 30 days unless immediate mitigated steps are taken’)</td><td>(M) Moderate</td><td>(PND) Pending</td><td>The lead developer will investigate this and the feasability of moving to the caGrid SSO.  If that is not possible, then this will effect CTMSi more than C3PR.</td><td>8</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>4/2/2007 4:59:24 PM</td><td>4/2/2007</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>Open</td><td>&nbsp;</font></td><td>External</td></tr><tr><td>679</td><td>C3PR Release 2.0 Construction & Transition Phase</td><td>Resource </td><td>There are no funds in the C3PR budget for travel to the CTMS WS F2F.
